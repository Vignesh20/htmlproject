            <h2><b>Audi</b></h2><br>
            Audi is a German automobile manufacturer that designs, engineers, produces, markets and distributes luxury vehicles.
            Audi oversees worldwide operations from its headquarters in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. Audi was founded by engineer August Horch;
             and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer). The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder,
             August Horch. "Horch", meaning "listen" in German, becomes
             "audi" in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi's
             predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi's slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, meaning "Advancement through Technology". However,
             since 2007 Audi USA has used the slogan "Truth in Engineering".[13] Audi is among the best-selling luxury automobiles in the world.

                  six-speed auto are standard; a manual is not offered. A 220-hp 2.0-liter four with all-wheel drive is optional; 2015 and 2016 TDI diesels
                  have been stop-saled until further notice due to EPA violations. An updated A3 debuts for 2017.
